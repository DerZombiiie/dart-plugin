# Dart Plugin

The dart plugin provides some extra niceties for using micro with
the Dart programming language. The main thing this plugin does is
run `dart format` for you automatically. 

You can run

```
> dartfmt
```

To automatically run these when you save the file, use the following
options:

* `dartfmt`: run `dart format` on file saved. Default value: `on`
